Jnana is an algorithmic accompaniment tool integrated into Ableton Live.  It has the ability to analyze MIDI input and generate new material in a similar style.  

_Scroll left to right past plugin in Ableton_

The live analysis plugin has the ability to analyze and "respond" to a midi input in real-time.  Here, the midi output of the accompaniment from the Ableton Live track is routed to the player piano so as Jen plays, the piano will respond to her.

_Cut to Jen playing with the accompaniment.  As the accompaniment is triggered, cut back to the Ableton session to show that the clip is being played and the piano roll is playing the notes that are being heard on the piano.  Show Jen jamming out for a few minutes._
